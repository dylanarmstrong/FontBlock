## Updating the domain list

If there's a external font domain that's getting through the filter
or this is breaking a website, please open a pull request with the domain
and a site or two on which it appears. We'll add it to the
[blocked domains list](/FontBlock.safariextension/blockerList.json)
and release a new version of the extension to include it.

## License

FontBlock is released under the terms of the MIT license. Check the LICENSE
file for details.

## Privacy Policy

Nothing is collected or stored.

## History

Forked from the excellent [Ka-Block!](https://github.com/dgraham/Ka-Block) project.
