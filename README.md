## Updating the domain list

If there's a external font domain that's getting through the filter, open
a pull request with the domain and a site or two on which it appears. We'll
add it to the [blocked domains list](/FontBlock.safariextension/blockerList.json)
and release a new version of the extension to include it.

## License

FontBlock is released under the terms of the MIT license. Check the LICENSE
file for details.

## History

Forked from the excellent [Ka-Block!](https://github.com/dgraham/Ka-Block) project.
